* CHANGELOG

** v0.2.0

Second release. Python 3.1+ only. Now also with support for a very simple
PyGame interface meant for graphics tablets and mice. Can now send notes to a
server and listen to them via another listener program instead of playing them
directly. This allows for more than one person to test soundfonts together.


** v0.1.0

Initial release. Support for Python 2.5+, not Python 3. Curses interface
only. Support for only one channel, no pitch bending, and no support for saving
sounds as MIDI files.
